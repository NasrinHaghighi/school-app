    <h1>Lisbon earthquake (1755)</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>The earthquake accompanied by a seaquake on the first day of November 1755 devastated the city of Lisbon, causing great damage, in particular the destruction of houses and the castle, as well as tens of thousands of dead and homeless people. In addition to natural disasters, the city was subjected to numerous fires that lasted several days.</p>
    <br/>
    <h1>Mondego and Douro Floods (1962)</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>With the rise in river levels, Mondego and Douro, the regions between these two rivers were completely flooded causing an undetermined number of deaths. However, these floods were considered one of the biggest floods of the 20th century.</p>
    <br/>
    <h1>Droughts (1901-2001)</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>Over the last century, there has been an increase in temperature in the warmer months and a decrease in precipitation, which has led several areas of Portugal, mainly in the interior and south, to declare extreme droughts. Although it cannot be considered a real disaster, these long periods of drought have caused serious problems for the populations, in particular those who live from agriculture.</p>

    <br/>
    <h1>Heat Wave (2003)</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>This sudden increase in heat led to the death of thousands of people, mostly elderly people or patients with respiratory problems or heart failure. These heat waves and their effects have been repeated over the last century with devastating results on the population.</p>

    <br/>
    <h1>Monchique fire (2018)</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>Forest fire that lasted for almost a week, causing various problems to the populations it affected, particularly due to the poor forest management in the region. The intervention of firefighters was hampered by the intensity of the winds, resulting in 41 injuries and 27,000 hectares of forest burned.</p>
