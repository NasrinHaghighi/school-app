    <h1>What is consumerism?</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>Consumerism is the lifestyle or a cultural mode that promotes the buying of goods
which you do not need or you buy in excess.</p>
    <h1>How does consumerism affect the environment and our lives?</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>For the production process to take place, polluting gases are produced that cause
pollution, destroying ecosystems, among other problems, which lead the planet to
devastation.</p>
    <p>When people buy more things, more things need to be produced. This leads to more
pollutant emissions, increased land-use, deforestation and accelerated climate change.</p>
    <br/>
    <h1>How to &quot;practice&quot; sustainable consumption?</h1>
    <br/>
   <ul>
    <li>Don&#39;t buy on impulse.</li>
    <li>Bet on conscious consumption.</li>
    <li>Replace plastic bags with ecohans (made of cotton or other materials
    considered sustainable).Avoid the use of chemicals to wash clothes and
    dishes.</li>
   </ul>
   <h1>How did consumerism arise?</h1>
   <p>Consumerism originated from the industrial revolution. 
After the processes of production and circulation of a given product were streamlined,
the population began to consume much more than they need.</p>
